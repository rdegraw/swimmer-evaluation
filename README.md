swimmer-evaluation
==================

Application that will capture swimming video, evaluate it, and report back visually for a swimmer:

This project may be a little bold, but it seems fun and Python looks like it has the tools for it.
The application will run in Windows - needed to download Anaconda to get all the modules that I need.

To do -
  Figure out video capture and analysis ~ simpleCV - can use openCV as well, but simple has an easier api
  Figure out appropriate GUI
